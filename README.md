# POD-Capture
## Description
POD-Capture is a mobile application that focuses on streamlining manufacturing businesses supply chain by ommiting the need for paper copies of documents such as invoices, delivery notes etc. POD-Capture ensures paper documentation can be electronically scanned by delivery drivers, saved and uploaded directly to the business backend systems.

What is a POD (proof of delivery)?
A proof of delivery is simply a document or digital record that confirms a recipient has received the correct goods. It is a vital part of the sales process and supply chain helping to ensure that customers receive their orders accurately and in good condition.
